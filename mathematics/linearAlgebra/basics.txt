tensor includes 
	-- > Scalar (0 dimensions, number)
	-- > 2d matrices
 	-- > Higher dimension matrices

Matrix operations:
	-- > adding, subtracting, multiplying & dividing a matrix by a scalar results in the matrix with the operation acted on every single element. Numpy uses c is makes this efficient


	-- > when doing the same with multiple matrices, they have to have the same shape


Matrix Multiplication:
	
	Matrix Multiplication is not the same as dot product!

	Matrix Product (dot product) 
		-- > a dot product is the multiplication of individual elements and their summation

			ex: [0,1,2]*[3,4,5] = 0*3 + 1*4 + 2*5 = 14
		-- > when doing dot product on matrices, we do the dot product of each row of the first, with each column of the second.
				So, the number of columns of the first must be equal to the number of rows of the second.
				The ending result is the size of the rows of the first and the cols of the second.
Tranpose:
	-- > Swaps rows to columns
	-- > Arrangement and shape of matrix changes p
	-- > You can only safely do a transpose to do a compatible matrix multiplication iff the data in both matrices is stores as rows NOT columns
